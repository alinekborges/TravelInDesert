 * There is a group of adventurers who like to travel in the desert.
 * Everyone knows travelling in desert can be very dangerous. That's why 
 * they plan their trip carefully every time. There are a lot of factors to consider before they 
 * make their final decision. One of the most important factors is the weather. It is undesirable to 
 * travel under extremely high temperature. They always try to avoid going to the hottest place. However, 
 * it is unavoidable sometimes as it might be on the only way to the destination. To decide where to go, 
 * they will pick a route that the highest temperature is minimized. If more than one route satisfy 
 * this criterion, they will choose the shortest one. There are several oases in the desert where 
 * they can take a rest. That means they are travelling from oasis to oasis before reaching the 
 * destination. They know the lengths and the temperatures of the paths between oases.
